# Onboarding Dashboard

A central location to see the status of your developers, and the services within your Organization.

## Onboarding Overview

As an organization adminstrator you will be able to see, how many of your developers have onboarded, who's still left to onboard, invite more of your developers, and see which services are currently being used across your Organization.

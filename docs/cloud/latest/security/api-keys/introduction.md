# Introduction

<Alert severity="warning">
  This feature is supported only if you're cluster is running Edge-stack 3.1 and above.
</Alert>

Edge stack allows to create different filters to enforce an authentication on top of your 
services. One of these authentication method is the use of simple API Keys.

The Cloud UI gives you the ability to create such autentication system, and then to manage
your own set of keys.

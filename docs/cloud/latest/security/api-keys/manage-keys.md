# Manage api keys

From this part of the interface, you can generate or revoke a key across multiple filters.

# Steps

First, browse through the different 'pools' of API keys, and unfold the one
you want to manage by clicking on it.

## Create a key

To create a key, click on **Create Key**, and provide a description. A key will be generated, and you can copy it to send it to a client.

It can take some seconds to transmit the key to your cluster.

## Revoke a key

To revoke a key, select the one you want to revoke, and click on **Revoke**. The key won't 
be usable anymore.

# Filter my service view

If you feel overwhelmed by the number of cluster namespaces and services displayed in the Service Catalog view, you may take advantage of the filtering options to personalize your view.

## Mark a Service as Favorite

On the main Service Catalog view: the service listing:

1. Locate the service you wish to add to your favorites.

2. Click on the service's **"..."** button to open the pop-up menu.

3. Click **Add to favorites**.

Favorited services will be displayed with a star icon next to the service name. 

Note that the services are favorited for specific environments.

## Mark a Cluster Namespace as Favorite

On the environment management page, which you can reach by clicking on the **Environments** item in the left-hand side navigation menu:

1. Locate the `cluster: namespace` you wish to add to your favorites.

2. Click on the `cluster: namespace`'s **"..."** button to open the pop-up menu.

3. Click **Add to favorites**.

Favorited `cluster: namespace` will be displayed with a star icon next to its name.

## Filter the view by Cluster Namespaces and Services

Customize your view by displaying only favorited cluster namespaces and services. This can be easily achieved by toggling the filters on the page's top bar from **All** to **Favorites**.

Filters are applied consecutively, starting with the cluster namespace selection, followed by services.

# Using the HUD

## Heads Up Display

With many widgets available, the HUD (Heads Up Display) is the perfect sidekick for any cloud-native developer. Developers gain a zoomed-in view with access to shortcuts, a quick way to create intercepts, a visualization of progressing rollouts, and more.

To activate the HUD, click on any service card in the Service Catalog. Contextual information about this specific service will always be visible on your screen.

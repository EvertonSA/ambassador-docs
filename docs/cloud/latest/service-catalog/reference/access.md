## RBAC

Ambassador Cloud supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to enforce permissions granted to members of a team.

Using roles, you can limit team members in their ability to perform certain actions. For example, only Administrators are allowed to change or cancel a team's paid subscription or grant roles to other team members.

You can easily access your team and member settings, as well as other personal options, under the [Settings section of Ambassador Cloud](https://app.getambassador.io/cloud/settings)

# Manage my subscriptions

Ambassador Labs provides a variety of different subscription options depending on your needs. Whether you're working with a small team with a few developers or a company with a large number of services and active namespaces, Ambassador Labs has flexible subscription options for you to chose from. 

## Check or upgrade your subscription

In user settings, go to the **Subscriptions** section.

Here you can change your subscription to upgrade your experience. This is where you can monitor your current plan & quotas. If you've met some of your plan limits, you can upgrade here.

  </p>

For example, the following team member quota is indicating that you have up to 10 spots available. If you reach the limit, you can either release one, or **upgrade** your plan to increase the limit.

## Unlock new features

In some plans you might be able to unlock additional active services and clusters, by adding team members to your organization. If you see the message to unlock in your subscription page, just click on the ‘INVITE’ button and follow the steps that will be displayed.

## Quota limits

If you already reached the limits, you might need to upgrade your plan. If that’s the case, you’ll run into a message like the one below while performing certain actions.

## Upgrade your plan

If one of the quota doesn't seem to be enough, click **upgrade** to increase your quotas.

This opens the following page:

 **Buy** the plan you want to be automatically redirected to the checkout page.

If neither of these plans meet your needs, click **contact sales** in the Enterprise subscription column to contact sales about Enterprise edition subscription details.

## Check or upgrade your subscription

In user settings, go to the **Subcriptions** section.

You might need to change your subscription to upgrade your experience. This is where you can monitor your current plan & quotas. If you've met some of your plan limits you can adjust it.

For example, the following team member quota is indicating that you have up to 10 spots available. If you reach the limit, you can either release one, or **upgrade** your plan to increase the limit.

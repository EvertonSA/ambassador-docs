# Visualizing APIs in your existing cluster

## Prerequisites

1. You must have Ambassador Edge Stack installed in your Kubernetes cluster. If you do not have edge stack installed go to [Edge Stack Quick start](../../../../edge-stack/2.0/tutorials/getting-started/)
2. Connect your cluster to the DCP

## Configure Edge stack to publish documents:

In order to display your API docs in the DCP, the edge stack running in your cluster needs to be configured to publish the serviceâ€™s Open API documentation. This is done by including a mapping that tells Edge stack the appropriate endpoint. For a complete list of the available mappings go [here](../../../../edge-stack/1.13/topics/using/dev-portal/)

If you would like to see an example of how this works, check the [Quick start](../quick-start)

## Visualize your API in the DCP

1. Navigate to [Ambassador Cloud](https://app.getambassador.io/cloud/services) to see your connected services.

2. Select the service from the Service Catalog page.

3. Click on the API tab to access the documentation.

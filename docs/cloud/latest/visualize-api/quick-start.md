# Quick start

## OpenAPI

You can visualize and explore your serviceâ€™s OpenAPI (formally known as Swagger Specifications) documentation from directly within the Developer Control Plane.

## Prerequisites

1. You must have [Ambassador Edge Stack installed](../../../../edge-stack/2.0/tutorials/getting-started) in your
   Kubernetes cluster. This quick start assumes you have deployed the `quote` app and
   apply `Mapping` from that quickstart.
2. Enable the documentation by modifying the file `quote-backend.yaml` with the following path `/.ambassador-internal/openapi-docs`

   ```yaml
   ---
   apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2
   kind: Mapping
   metadata:
     name: quote-backend
     namespace: ambassador
   spec:
     prefix: /backend/
     service: quote
     docs:
       path: '/.ambassador-internal/openapi-docs'
   ```

3. Apply the configuration to the cluster:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f quote-backend.yaml
   ```

## Connect your cluster to Ambassador Cloud

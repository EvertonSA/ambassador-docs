# Quick start

## OpenAPI

You can visualize and explore your serviceâ€™s OpenAPI specification (formerly known as Swagger) documentation from within Ambassador Cloud.

## Prerequisites

1. You must have [Ambassador Edge Stack version 2.0+ installed and connected to Ambassador Cloud](../../service-catalog/quick-start) in your
   Kubernetes cluster. This guide assumes you have deployed the `quote` application and resources from the Service Catalog quick start.
2. Enable reporting the `quote` service documentation by creating, or editing, the `quote-backend` AmbassadorMapping resource with the following docs path `/.ambassador-internal/openapi-docs`

   ```
   echo '---
   apiVersion: x.getambassador.io/v3alpha1
   kind: AmbassadorMapping
   metadata:
     name: quote-backend
     namespace: ambassador
   spec:
     hostname: "*"
     prefix: /backend/
     service: quote
     docs:
       path: '/.ambassador-internal/openapi-docs'
   ' | kubectl apply -f -
   ```

## Visualize the API Documentation

1. Navigate to [Ambassador Cloud](https://app.getambassador.io/cloud/services) to see your connected services.

2. Select the quote service from the Service Catalog page.

3. Click on the API tab to access the rendered OpenAPI documentation.

You've published your service documentation on Ambassador Cloud to enable collaboration with other teams and members of your organization, but you can extend your services AmbassadorMapping with [other Developer Portal docs options](../../../edge-stack/latest/topics/using/dev-portal/#docs-attribute-in-mappings), and **Service Catalog annotations!**  See the full list of service annotations [here](../reference/annotations/).

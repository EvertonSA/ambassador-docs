# Telepresence Intercept Definitions

To make it easier to share Telepresence intercept configuration across team members, Ambassador Cloud saves intercept
definitions when [the `--save-intercept-definition-as` flag](../../../telepresence/latest/reference/intercepts#sharing-intercept-definition-with-teammates)
is provided with the `telepresence intercept` command.

## Managing intercept definitions

By navigating to the [Telepresence Intercept Definitions page on Ambassador Cloud](https://app.getambassador.io/cloud/telepresence-intercept-definitions),
you can see the list of intercept definitions. For each of these, you can:

- inspect its author, creation date, updated date and flags
- review the previous versions
- delete a definition
- launch an instance of the definition through a connected Telepresence daemon

# Connecting Edge Stack to Ambassador Cloud

The Ambassador Cloud's Developer Control Plane (DCP) provides an easy way to visualize and manage your services. With Ambassador Cloud, you can monitor services and clusters, manage deployments and rollouts, create mappings, and simplify your Kubernetes delivery cycles.

To connect to Ambassador Cloud:

1. Log in to [Ambassador Cloud](https://app.getambassador.io/cloud/services/) with either GitHub, GitLab, or Google, and select your team account.

2. Click **Add Services** then click **Connection Instructions** in the "Connect your installation" section.

3. Follow the prompts to name the cluster and click **Generate a Cloud Token**.

4. Follow the prompts to install the cloud token into your cluster.

Ambassador Cloud now shows your connected services in the DCP. The power of Edge Stack, especially when combined with Telepresence and Argo in your DCP, allows you to quickly and easily harness the power of Ambassador Labs' capabilities.

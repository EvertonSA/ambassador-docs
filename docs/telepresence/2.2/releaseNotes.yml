    notes:
      - title: Ambassador namespace detection
        body: Improve ambassador namespace detection that was trying to create the namespace even when the namespace existed, which was an undesired RBAC escalation for operators.

        type: bugfix
      - title: Traffic improvement
        body: Telepresence will now no longer generate excessive traffic trying repeatedly to exchange auth tokens with Ambassador Cloud. This could happen when upgrading from <2.1.4 if you had an expired telepresence login from before upgrading.
        #docs: howtos/route/
        type: bugfix
      - title: Telepresence login
        body: Telepresence login now correctly handles expired logins, just like all of the other subcommands.

    date: '2021-04-19'
    notes:
      - title: Port Support

        body: Telepresence no longer generates port names longer than 15 characters.
